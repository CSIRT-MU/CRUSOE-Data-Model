Buffer overflow in FileZilla,<0.9.31,CVE-2009-0884,CWE-119,5,allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors related to SSL/TLS packets
The mod_deflate module in Apache httpd,<2.2.11,CVE-2009-1891,CWE-399,7.1,"The mod_deflate module in Apache httpd 2.2.11 and earlier compresses large files until completion even after the associated network connection is closed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)."
Default or null passwords in XAMPP,<=1.4.x,CVE-2005-1078,Null,7.5,"XAMPP 1.4.x has multiple default or null passwords, which allows attackers to gain privileges."
Arbitrary commands execution in Perl,<5.17.7,CVE-2012-6329,CWE-94,7.5,"The _compile function in Maketext.pm in the Locale::Maketext implementation in Perl before 5.17.7 does not properly handle backslashes and fully qualified method names during compilation of bracket notation, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted input to an application that accepts translation strings from users, as demonstrated by the TWiki application before 5.1.3, and the Foswiki application 1.0.x through 1.0.10 and 1.1.x through 1.1.6."
Invalid handling of session ID in Apache HTTP server,<2.4.5,CVE-2013-2249,Null,7.5,"mod_session_dbd.c in the mod_session_dbd module in the Apache HTTP Server before 2.4.5 proceeds with save operations for a session without considering the dirty flag and the requirement for a new session ID, which has unspecified impact and remote attack vectors."
Availability changes in MariaDB,<5.5.50,CVE-2016-3521,Null,6.8,"Unspecified vulnerability in Oracle MySQL 5.5.49 and earlier, 5.6.30 and earlier, and 5.7.12 and earlier and MariaDB before 5.5.50, 10.0.x before 10.0.26, and 10.1.x before 10.1.15 allows remote authenticated users to affect availability via vectors related to Server: Types."
Arbitrary code execution in MariaDB,<5.5.51,CVE-2016-6662,CWE-264,10,"Oracle MySQL through 5.5.52, 5.6.x through 5.6.33, and 5.7.x through 5.7.15; MariaDB before 5.5.51, 10.0.x before 10.0.27, and 10.1.x before 10.1.17; and Percona Server before 5.5.51-38.1, 5.6.x before 5.6.32-78.0, and 5.7.x before 5.7.14-7 allow local users to create arbitrary configurations and bypass certain protection mechanisms by setting general_log_file to a my.cnf configuration."
Incorrect input handling in PHP,<5.6.31,CVE-2017-11142,CWE-400,10,"In PHP before 5.6.31, 7.x before 7.0.17, and 7.1.x before 7.1.3, remote attackers could cause a CPU consumption denial of service attack by injecting long form variables, related to main/php_variables.c."
Incorrect privileges handling in PostgreSQL,<9.2.21,CVE-2017-7484,CWE-200,5,"It was found that some selectivity estimation functions in PostgreSQL before 9.2.21, 9.3.x before 9.3.17, 9.4.x before 9.4.12, 9.5.x before 9.5.7, and 9.6.x before 9.6.3 did not check user privileges before providing information from pg_statistic, possibly leaking information. An unprivileged attacker could use this flaw to steal some information from tables they are otherwise not allowed to access."
Inproper SSL/TLS connection in PostgreSQL,<9.3.x,CVE-2017-7485,CWE-310,4.3,"In PostgreSQL 9.3.x before 9.3.17, 9.4.x before 9.4.12, 9.5.x before 9.5.7, and 9.6.x before 9.6.3, it was found that the PGREQUIRESSL environment variable was no longer enforcing a SSL/TLS connection to a PostgreSQL server. An active Man-in-the-Middle attacker could use this flaw to strip the SSL/TLS protection from a connection between a client and a server."
Information leak in PostgreSQL,8.4 â€“ 9.6,CVE-2017-7486,CWE-200,5,PostgreSQL versions 8.4 - 9.6 are vulnerable to information leak in pg_user_mappings view which discloses foreign server passwords to any user having USAGE privilege on the associated foreign server.
Montgomery squaring procedure bug in OpenSSL,<1.0.2,CVE-2017-3732,CWE-200,4.3,There is a carry propagating bug in the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure in OpenSSL 1.0.2 before 1.0.2k and 1.1.0 before 1.1.0d. No EC algorithms are affected. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not believed likely.
Out-of-bonds read in OpenSSL,<1.1.0,CVE-2017-3731,CWE-125,5,"If an SSL/TLS server or client is running on a 32-bit host, and a specific cipher is being used, then a truncated packet can cause that server or client to perform an out-of-bounds read, usually resulting in a crash. For OpenSSL 1.1.0, the crash can be triggered when using CHACHA20/POLY1305; users should upgrade to 1.1.0d"
